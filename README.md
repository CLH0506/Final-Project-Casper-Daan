Final Project SAW Casper Daan
Welcome to the Self-Avoiding Walk project! This project is designed to simulate and visualize self-avoiding walks on a two-dimensional grid. A self-avoiding walk is a mathematical concept where a walker moves on a grid, never revisiting a previously traversed cell. This project aims to explore various algorithms for generating self-avoiding walks and provides a visual representation of these walks. We have a few features, namely:

Simulation: Generate self-avoiding walks on a grid using different algorithms.
Visualization: Visualize the generated walks on both a 2D square and triangle lattices.
Customization: You can control the grid size, length of the SAW and the starting position.

Thank you for checking out our project
