Final Project SAW Casper Daan
Welcome to our project about self avoiding walks. We have e few features.
Simulation: Generate self-avoiding walks on a grid using different algorithms.
Visualization: Visualize the generated walks in a 2D square and triangle grid.
Customization: You can control the grid size, starting position, and visualization options.
