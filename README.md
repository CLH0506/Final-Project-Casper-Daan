Final Project SAW Casper Daan
Welcome to the Self-Avoiding Walk project! This project is designed to simulate and visualize self-avoiding walks on a two-dimensional grid. A self-avoiding walk is a mathematical concept where a walker moves on a grid, never revisiting a previously traversed cell. This project aims to explore various algorithms for generating self-avoiding walks and provides a visual representation of these walks. We have a few features, namely:

Simulation: Generate self-avoiding walks on a grid using different algorithms

Visualization: Visualize the generated walks on both a 2D square and triangle lattices.

Customization: The project is very customizable, allowing users to control various aspects of the self-avoiding walks:

-Grid Size: Adjust the size of the grid to explore walks in different spatial dimensions.

-Starting Position: Define the starting position of the walker on the square grid, influencing the initial conditions of the self-avoiding walk.

-Walk Length: Customize the length of the self-avoiding walk, providing flexibility in exploring walks of different durations.
